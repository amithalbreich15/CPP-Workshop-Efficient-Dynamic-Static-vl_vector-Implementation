# CPP-Efficient-Dynamic-Static-vl_vector-Implementation
This project implements a highly efficient, flexible vector-like container in C++, named vl_vector. The design optimally balances between stack and heap memory usage, offering improved runtime efficiency and minimal memory overhead. This exercise is part of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem's advanced C++ programming curriculum.
